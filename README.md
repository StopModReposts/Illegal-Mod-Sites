StopModReposts is a movement against illegal redistribution of Minecraft content, mainly focused on mods. The movement consists of a [website](http://stopmodreposts.org/), a [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopModReposts&src=savs), a [list of illegal mod mirrors](), and a [browser plugin](https://stopmodreposts.org/extension). We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and a [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/StopModReposts).

## Submitting a site
To report a site which is illegally redistributing mods, please open an issue in our [issue tracker](http://git.io/jaB7), submit a pull request or join our [Discord sever](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and use the `/submit` command in the #submit-site channel. We are currently targeting reposting of the following content types: mods, resource packs, maps, and modpacks. In addition, we target websites providing malicious Minecraft content.
