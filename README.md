StopModReposts is a movement against illegal redistribution of Minecraft content, mainly focused on mods. The movement consists of a [website](http://stopmodreposts.org/), a [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopModReposts&src=savs), a [list of illegal mod mirrors](http://git.io/jaBI), and a [browser plugin](https://stopmodreposts.org/dl/extension.html). We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and a [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/StopModReposts).

To report a site that might be illegally redistributing mods, please open an issue in our [issue tracker](http://git.io/jaB7) or submit a pull request. We do currently target reposts of the following content types: mods, resource packs, maps, and modpacks. In addition, we target websites providing malicious Minecraft content.

## Submitting Translations

We also allow translations to be submitted now. Please see the [translator guide](https://github.com/VictiniX888/Illegal-Mod-Sites/wiki/Translator-guide) on the wiki for more information.

## API / Serialized Formats

StopModReposts provides its site list in various data formats that may be useful for developers. These list formats are available by querying an external API. Please see [API access and formats](https://github.com/VictiniX888/Illegal-Mod-Sites/wiki/API-access-and-formats) on the wiki for more information about this API.
