The StopModReposts movement is a movement against illegal redistribution of Minecraft content, mainly focused on mods. The movement consists of a [website](http://stopmodreposts.org/), a [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopModReposts&src=savs), a [list of illegal mod mirrors](http://git.io/jaBI), and a [browser plugin](https://stopmodreposts.org/extension). We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and a [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/StopModReposts).

## Submitting a site
To report a site which is illegally redistributing mods, please open an issue in our [issue tracker](http://git.io/jaB7), submit a pull request or join our [Discord sever](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and use the `/submit` command in the `#submit-site` channel also when submitting a site make sure it is not already on our [list](https://stopmodreposts.org/sites) and a "repost site" that links backs to the original download page does not count as a repost site. We are currently targeting reposting of the following content types: mods, resource packs, maps, and modpacks. In addition, we target websites providing malicious Minecraft content.


## Submitting Translations

We also allow translations to be submitted now. Please see the [translator guide](https://github.com/StopModReposts/Illegal-Mod-Sites/wiki/Translator-guide) on the wiki for more information.

## API / Serialized Formats

StopModReposts provides its site list in various data formats that may be useful for developers. These list formats are available by querying an external API. Please see [API access and formats](https://github.com/StopModReposts/Illegal-Mod-Sites/wiki/API-access-and-formats) on the wiki for more information about this API.
