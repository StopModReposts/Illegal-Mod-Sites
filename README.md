StopModReposts is a movement against illegal redistribution of Minecraft content, mainly focused on mods. The movement consists of a [website](http://stopmodreposts.org/), a [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StopModReposts&src=savs), a [list of illegal mod mirrors](https://github.com/StopModReposts/Illegal-Mod-Sites/blob/master/SITES.md), and a [browser plugin](https://stopmodreposts.org/extension). We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zg4tt2M) and a [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/StopModReposts).

## Submitting a site
