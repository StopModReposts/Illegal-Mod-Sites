How To Read The Rating System
=============================

## Advertising
The more points, the more ads the site has
AdFly links automatically give 5.

## Redistribution
If redistribution is 1, the site doesn't redistribute the mod (e.g. Links directly to the original download).  
If redistribution is 3, the site doesn't actually redistribute the mod (e.g. skydaz/installers).  
If redistribution is 5, the site is redistributing the mod.  
Bypassing AdFly links count as redistribution.

##Lying
Whether the site is lying or not. Stuff taken into account are:
+ credit to original mod author
+ outdated mod versions
+ non-existent mod versions.
