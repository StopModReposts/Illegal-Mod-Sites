La violation de copyright est une situation quotidienne pour les moddeurs de Minecraft. La plupart des mods quelque peu populaires aujourd'hui ont à un moment donné été illégalement copié et redistribué sur un site de tierce partie, sans aucun accusé de réception ou la permission de leurs développeurs. Beaucoup de ces sites sont hébergés au Vietnam ou en Russie et sont difficiles à supprimer en raison des différentes législations en matière de droit d'auteur. Beaucoup de ces sites monétisent illégalement leurs liens de téléchargement pour gagner de l’argent grâce au travail acharné des moddeurs, et plusieurs vont même jusqu'à revendiquer la propriété du contenu illégal. Some of them are known to host malware and viruses and claim that these are real, harmless mods. This has to stop.

When DMCAs and take-down notices fail, we have to rely on the community to stop people from downloading mods from these sources. However, many of the websites engaging in the type of activity outlined above look very well designed and official, confusing many players and making them believe that these sites are actually the real ones. As a result, many machines are infected with viruses and malware, modders lose revenue and reputation and are spammed with reports about bugs which have already been fixed in newer versions of their mods, since only the old versions are hosted on the illegal sites. Stop Mod Reposts is designed to stop this. Here's how we plan to do it:

- Letting people know that the sites are illegal. There is no way we can stop people from using these sites when they're unaware that the actions of the host is against the law and that the host is ignorant of the modders' rights. Therefore, this extension will display an overlay when browsing a site like this.
- Letting people know that visiting these sites puts their computers at risk. No one wants to be infected with malware, so we'll warn them that the sites potentially can harm their machines.

This extension is developed by bilde2910, just another member of the modding community. The website StopModReposts.org is designed and developed by other members, so we're not directly affiliated with each other. The same goes for @StopModReposts on Twitter. If you have any reports or questions, feel free to tweet at @bilde2910, or send an e-mail to marius (at) varden (dot) info. You can also look for bilde2910 in the #stopmodreposts channel on the EsperNet IRC network.

The sites this extension warns about are the same sites as are listed on https://github.com/VictiniX888/Illegal-Mod-Sites and is updated every few days or hours with new hosts. If you own one of these sites and want to be removed from the list, I suggest you have a chat with the people of the #stopmodreposts channel on EsperNet, they'll see if it's a good idea or not to have you removed.
