How To Read The Rating System
=============================

## Advertising
The more points, the more ads the site has.  
AdFly links and/or use of similar services automatically give 5.

## Redistribution
If redistribution is 1, the site doesn't redistribute the mod (e.g. Links directly to the original download).  
If redistribution is 3, the site doesn't actually redistribute the mod (e.g. installers).  
If redistribution is 5, the site is redistributing the mod.  

## Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous exacerbating circumstances. Examples of stuff taken into account are:
+ missing credit to original mod author
+ outdated mod versions
+ non-existent mod versions.
+ bypassing AdFly links
+ claiming that it is a forge mod when to original mod is fabric
